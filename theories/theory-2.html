        <p>
            Solipsism is a philosophical theory, which asserts that nothing exists but the individual’s consciousness.
            At first it seems silly – and who generally got it into his head completely deny the existence of the world
            around us? Except when you put your mind to it, it really is impossible to verify anything but your own
            consciousness.</p>

        <p>Don’t you believe me? Think a moment and think of all the possible dreams that you have experienced in your
            life. Is it not possible that everything around you is nothing but an incredibly intricate dream? But we
            have people and things around us that we cannot doubt, because we can hear, see, smell, taste and feel them,
            right? Yes, and no. People who take LSD, for example, say that they can touch the most convincing
            hallucinations, but we do not claim that their visions are “reality”. Your dreams simulate sensations as
            well, after all, what you perceive is what different sections of your brain tell you to.
        </p>

        <p>As a result, which parts of existence can we not doubt? None. Not the chicken we ate for dinner or the
            keyboard beneath our fingers. Each of us can only be sure in his own thoughts.

        <h1>2. Idealist Philosophy.</h1>

        <p>
            George Berkeley, the father of Idealism, argued that everything exists as an idea in someone’s mind. Berkley
            discovered that some of his comrades considered his theory stupid. The story goes that one of his detractors
            kicked a stone with his eyes closed and said, “There I’ve disproved it!”
        </p>
        <p>The idea being that if the stone really only exists in his imagination, he could not have kicked it with his
            eyes closed. Refutation of Berkeley is hard to understand, especially in these days. He argued that there is
            an omnipotent and omnipresent God, who sees all and all at once. Realistic, or not?</p>
        
            <h1>3. Plato and Logos.</h1>
        <img src="../images/4. Plato and Logos.webp" alt="" class="image">
        <p>Everybody has heard of Plato. He is the world’s most famous philosopher. Like all philosophers he had a few
            things to say about reality. He argued that beyond our perceived reality there lies a world of “perfect”
            forms. Everything that we see is just a shade, an imitation of how things truly are. He argued that by
            studying philosophy we have a chance of catching a glimpse of how things truly are, of discovering the
            perfect forms of everything we perceive.</p>
        <p>In addition to this stunning statement, Plato, being a monist, said that everything is made of a single
            substance. Which means (according to him) that diamonds, gold and dog feces all consist of the same basic
            material, but in a different form, which, with science’s discovery of atoms and molecules, has been proven
            true to an extent.
