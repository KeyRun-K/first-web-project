        <h1>1. Eternalism.</h1>
        <img src="../images/6. Eternalism.webp" alt="" class="image">
        <p>Enternalism is the exact opposite of presentism. This is a philosophical theory that says that time is
            multi-layered. It can be compared to a pound cake (however, unlike the time, a biscuit is not up for
            philosophical debate). All time exists simultaneously, but the measurement is determined by the observer.
            What he sees depends on which point he is looking at.</p>
        <p>Thus dinosaurs, World War II and Michael Jackson all exist simultaneously but can only be observed from a
            specific location. If one takes this view of reality then the future is hopeless and the deterministic free
            will is illusory.</p>

        <h1>2. Presentism.</h1>
        <img src="../images/5. Presentism.webp" alt="" class="image">
        <p>Time is something that we perceive as a matter of course, if we view it at the moment, we usually divide it
            into past, present and future. Presentism argues that the past and the future are imagined concepts, while
            only the present is real.</p>
        <p>In other words, today’s breakfast and every word of this article will cease to exist after you have read it,
            until you open it again. The future is just as imaginary, because time cannot exist before and after it
            happened, as claimed by St. Augustine.</p>

        <h1>3. Phenomenalism.</h1>
        <img src="../images/9. Phenomenalism.webp" alt="" class="image">
        <p>Everyone is interested in what happens to things when we aren’t looking at them. Scientists have carefully
            studied this problem and some of them came to a simple conclusion – they disappear. Well, not quite like
            this. Phenomenalist philosophers believe that objects only exist as a phenomenon of consciousness. So, your
            laptop is only here while you are aware of, and believe in its existence, but when you turn away from it, it
            ceases to exist until you or someone else interacts with it. There is no existence without perception. This
            is the root of phenomenalism.</p>
