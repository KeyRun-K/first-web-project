        <h1>1. Great glaciation.</h1>
        <img src="../images/1. Great glaciation..webp" alt="" class="image">
        <p>Great glaciation is the theory of the final state that our universe is heading toward. The universe has a
            limited supply of energy. According to this theory, when that energy finally runs out, the universe will
            devolve into a frozen state. Heat energy produced by the motion of the particles, heat loss, a natural
            law
            of the universe, means that eventually this particle motion will slow down and, presumably, one day
            everything will stop.</p>
        <h1>2. The Multiverse Theory.</h1>
        <img src="../images/8. The Multiverse Theory.webp" alt="" class="image">
        <p>Anyone who has not spent the last ten years on a desert island, has at least once heard of “the
            multiverse”,
            or parallel universes. As many of us have seen, parallel words, in theory, are worlds very similar to
            ours,
            with little (or in some cases, large) changes or differences. The multiverse theory speculates that
            there
            could exist an infinite number of these alternate realities.</p>
        <p>What’s the point? In a parallel reality you have already killed the dinosaurs, and you are lying under
            the
            ground at a depth of eight feet (because that’s what happened there.) In the other you might be a
            powerful
            dictator. In another you might never have even been born since your parents never met. Now that’s a
            memorable image.</p>
        <h1>3. The Brain in a Jar.</h1>
        <img src="../images/7. The Brain in a Jar.webp" alt="" class="image">
        <p>The “brain in a jar” thought experiment is a question discussed by thinkers and scientists, who, like
            most
            people, believe that human’s understanding of reality depends solely on his subjective feelings.</p>
        <p>So, what is the debate? Imagine that you are just a brain in a jar that is run by aliens or mad
            scientists.
            How would you know? And can you truly deny the possibility that this is your reality?</p>
        <p>This is a modern interpretation of the Cartesian evil demon problem. This thought experiment leads to the
            same conclusion: we cannot confirm the actual existence of anything except our consciousness. If this
            seems
            to sound reminiscent of the movie “The Matrix“, it is only because this idea was part of the very basis
            of
            the story. Unfortunately, in reality we have no red pills…</p>
